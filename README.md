# Uflow React

## How to get started

If you don't want to run the app locally, just visit https://uflow-b640f.firebaseapp.com (the simpliest way to run the app).

If you want to run the app locally, please follow the instructions below. :)

You will need a local webserver that will serve this app. Follow the instructions below to install all the needed dependencies (e.g. the framework libraries) and the development webserver.

1. First, make sure that you have npm installed on your system (follow the instructions
   at [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

2. Run `npm install` through the terminal in the root of the repository. Let it
   install all the dependencies.

3. Run `npm start` through the terminal. This will start the webserver and the application should pop up in your browser ready for use. Alternatively you can open in through [http://localhost:3000]. Whenever you make changes in your code and save, the browser will update automatically, so you don't have to click refresh anymore.
